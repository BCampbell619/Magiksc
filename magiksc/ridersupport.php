<h2 class="display-4 blueDark">RIDER SUPPORT</h2>
<p class="lead">Please take the time to read through this page prior to submitting your request, as it will walk you through the process and answer most of your questions about our sponsorship program.  Please feel free to call us &#40;951-654-5550&#41; if you have any questions after reading.</p>

<h4 class="blueMed">WHEN:</h4>
<p><b>Oct 1st</b> &ndash; <b>Dec 1st</b> each year. We would love to sponsor everyone who submits info but unfortunately we have a set number of rider spots available each year. We will not consider applicants after our cut off date.</p>

<h4 class="blueMed">SUBMITTING A REQUEST FOR SPONSORSHIP</h4>

<p>Magik Kustoms will accept a request one of two ways, please do not do both:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Completely fill out and submit our the online application.</li>
    <li>Email in a copy of your current resume. Please note that the majority of our interaction back to you will be via email.</li>
</ol>

<h4 class="blueMed">OPTION 1: ONLINE APPLICATION</h4>

<p>Please fill out the online application completely and submit it through the site. All of this information is vital to making our selection, so please make sure that all of the information is filled in and accurate.

<h4 class="blueMed">OPTION 2: EMAILING YOUR PERSONAL RESUME</h4>

<p>If you choose to submit your resume instead of the provided application, make sure to keep the following in mind:</p>
<ol>
    <li>We go through alot of resumes every year, so be as informative as possible but keep it short and concise.</li>
    <li>Please submit a neatly typed and organized resume. <strong>WE DO NOT GRADE ON GRAMMER BUT A WELL PUT TOGETHER RESUME SHOWING YOU HAVE (OR ARE WORKING ON) AN EDUCATION HELPS</strong>.</li>
    <li>It is very important you list all your contact info. Name, address, phone, email etc.</li>
    <li>Photos, Videos and any other media you have is welcome. A well prepped bike shows us you take pride in your sport and represent your sponsors in a positive way. <strong>DO NOT TELL US &quot;CHECK OUT MY FACEBOOK OR INSTAGRAM&quot;</strong>.</li>
    <li>These are some key areas that we would like you to include in your resume:
    <ul>
        <li>Brief bio (age, class for the upcoming season, how you got started, projected race schedule, etc)</li>
        <li>Your current report card (if you are still in school). We value the school results as high as the race results.</li>
        <li>Career highlights</li>
        <li>Current year race results we do not need every moto finish of every race you have entered, please keep it simple.</li>
        <li>1-4 photos will be sufficient. A head shot and couple action shots will work just fine. These pictures will not be returned to you, so please plan accordingly.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h4 class="blueMed">THE NEXT STEP</h4>

<p>You should expect an e-mail response within a few weeks of submitting your request for sponsorship. This is a very busy time of year for the rider support team, so please be patient and allow sufficient time for your resume to be reviewed. Once you receive a response, you will need to follow the instructions included in that e-mail.</p>

<h4 class="blueMed">LEVELS OF SPONSORSHIP</h4>
 
<p>There are 4 basic levels that make up our rider support program:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Level 1:</b> Magik&#39;s base support level is 15% off retail pricing on all Magik products. This does not include seat covers or plastics and does not work with any other sales promotion. This is the stepping stone to what we hope to be a long relationship that can help you get to the upper levels in our program.</li>
    <li><b>Level 2:</b> The next level is 30% off and typically amateur riders from previous years can easily obtain this.</li>
    <li><b>Level 3:</b> Our last level before full sponsorship. 50% off plus plenty of free swag to keep you looking fresh from tip to toe. Typically for riders that are about to get there Pro License.</li>
    <li><b>Level 4:</b> Full sponsorship. This is achieved only by riders racing at a pro level. The number of spots here are limited but we hope to see get here. </li>
</ul>
